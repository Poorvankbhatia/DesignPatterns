Each object in the chain acts as a handler and has a successor object.
If it can handle the request, it does; otherwise, it forwards the request to its successor.

Decouples the sender of the request and its receivers.
Simplifies your object because it doesn’t have to know the chain’s structure and keep direct references to its members.
Allows you to add or remove responsibilities dynamically by changing the members or order of the chain.

Commonly used in windows systems to handle events like mouse clicks and keyboard events.
