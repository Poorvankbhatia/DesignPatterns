Let us assume that we are building a simple design to keep the data and model of the available mobile phones in the market.
Here, we have a number of mobile phones to take into account with various models and overlapping specs.
How can we implement the design?

One way to do that is by using the traditional inheritance.
We will create a base Phone class and multiple subclasses for different phone combinations in specs and the model.

Here is the catch â€” we cannot create n number of mobile phones through inheritance,
especially when we know specs will overlap for multiple phones.
