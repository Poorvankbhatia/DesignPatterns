Starbuzz Coffee has made a name for itself as the fastest growing coffee shop around.
If you’ve seen one on your local corner, look across the street; you’ll see another one.

Because they’ve grown so quickly, they’re scrambling to update their ordering systems to match their beverage offerings.

In addition to your coffee, you can also ask for several condiments like steamed milk, soy,
and mocha (otherwise known as chocolate), and have it all topped off with whipped milk.
Starbuzz charges a bit for each of these, so they really need to get them built into their order system.
