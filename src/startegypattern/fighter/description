Suppose we are building a game “Street Fighter”.
For simplicity assume that a character may have four moves that is kick, punch, roll and jump.
Every character has kick and punch moves, but roll and jump are optional. How would you model your classes?
Fighter class will we have default implementation of normal actions.
