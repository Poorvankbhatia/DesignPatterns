Consider a captain(Class) that can only use rowing boats and cannot sail at all.

We have classes RowingBoat and FishingBoat.
And captain expects an implementation of RowingBoat interface to be able to move
Now let's say the pirates are coming and our captain needs to escape but there is only fishing boat available.
We need to create an adapter that allows the captain to operate the fishing boat with his rowing boat skills.
