The weather station has a WeatherData object,
which tracks current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure).
We’d like you to create an application that initially provides three display elements:
current conditions, weather statistics, and a simple forecast,
all updated in real time as the WeatherData object acquires the most recent measurements.

Further, this is an expandable weather station. We wants to release an API so that other developers
can write their own weather displays and plug them right in. We’d like for you to supply that API!

The three players in the system are:
The weather station (the physical device that acquires the actual weather data),
The WeatherData object (that tracks the data coming from the Weather Station and updates the displays),
The display that shows users the current weather conditions.

The WeatherData object knows how to talk to the physical Weather Station, to get updated data.
The WeatherData object then updates its displays for the three different display elements:
Current Conditions (shows temperature, humidity, and pressure), Weather Statistics, and a simple forecast.

Job is to create an app that uses the WeatherData object to update three displays for
current conditions, weather stats, and a forecast.
