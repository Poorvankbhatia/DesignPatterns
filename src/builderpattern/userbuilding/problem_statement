In the management module, primary entity is User, let’s say.
Ideally and practically as well, once a user object is fully created, you will not want to change it’s state.
It simply does not make sense, right? Now, let’s assume, our User object has following 5 attributes
i.e. firstName, lastName, age, phone and address.

In normal practice, if you want to make a immutable User class, then you must pass all five information as parameters
to constructor but what if  only firstName and lastName are mandatory and rest 3 fields are optional.

How do we deal with it without having many constructors.
