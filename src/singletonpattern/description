Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance , and provides global point of access to it.


Singleton objects are used for various applications.
-> Thread pools
-> Objects used for logging.
-> Objects that handle preferences or registry settings.

For many of these objects if we instantiate more than one we might run into problems like inconsistent results, overuse of
resources etc.

Singleton pattern is a convention meaning only 1 object instantiated for a class.

Unique instance holds the value of the instance.
Note if we never need the instance it never gets created , Lazy initialization.
