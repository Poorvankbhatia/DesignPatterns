The client creates some orders for buying and selling stocks (ConcreteCommands).
Then the orders are sent to the agent (Invoker).
The agent takes the orders and place them to the StockTrade system (Receiver).
The agent keeps an internal queue with the order to be placed.
Let's assume that the StockTrade system is closed each Monday, but the agent accepts orders,
and queue them to be processed later on.
